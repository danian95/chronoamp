<p><span class="math inline">\(\require{mhchem} \ce{}\)</span>In a
chronoamperometry experiment we apply a potential pulse to an electrode
and measure (‑<em>ometry</em>) the current (‑<em>amper</em>‑) that flows
as a function of time (<em>chrono</em>‑) in an unstirred solution. The
panel on the right provides four views of an experiment in which an
oxidized species, Ox, undergoes an <em>n</em> electron reduction to give
its reduced form, Red. <span class="math display">\[\ce{Ox} + n e^{-}
\ce{\rightleftharpoons} \ce{Red}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Ladder Diagram (upper left)</strong>. A ladder (or
predominance) diagram shows the relative stability of an analyte’s
oxidized and reduced forms as a function of the applied potential and
the analyte’s formal potential, which in this case is –<span class="math inline">\(0.25\)</span> V. For potentials more positive than
–<span class="math inline">\(0.25\)</span> V, the analyte’s oxidized
form is more stable than its reduced form, and for potentials more
negative than –<span class="math inline">\(0.25\)</span> V, the
analyte’s reduced form is more stable than its oxidized form. At the
formal potential, the oxidized and reduced forms are equally stable, and
equal in concentration.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Profile (upper right)</strong>. In a
chronoamperometry experiment, the applied potential profile has three
parts: first, the potential is set and held constant at a value where
the analyte does not undergo an oxidation or a reduction reaction;
second, the potential is pulsed to a value where the analyte is oxidized
or reduced; and, third, the applied potential is held at this value. In
the experiment shown here a potential of 0.5 V is applied for <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> seconds, pulsed to a potential of
–<span class="math inline">\(0.50\)</span> V, and then held at this
potential for an additional <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Diffusion Profiles (lower left)</strong>. A diffusion profile
shows the concentration of the analyte’s oxidized and reduced forms as a
function of distance from the electrode’s surface at a specific time;
here the diffusion profiles are shown at the beginning of the experiment
(<em>t</em> = <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> s) and at the end
of the experiment (<em>t</em> = <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>
s).</p>
<p><strong>Chronoamperogram (lower right)</strong>. The chronoamperogram
shows the current that flows as a function of time. This is the tangible
result of a chronoamperometry experiment.</p>
