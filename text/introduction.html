<p><span class="math inline">\(\require{mhchem} \ce{}\)</span>In a
chronoamperometry experiment we apply a potential pulse to an electrode
and measure <span class="math inline">\((-ometry)\)</span> the current
<span class="math inline">\((-amper-)\)</span> that flows as a function
of time <span class="math inline">\((chrono-)\)</span> in an unstirred
solution. The figure on the right provides four views of a
chronoamperometry experiment in which an oxidized analyte undergoes an
<em>n</em> electron reduction at the electrode <span class="math display">\[\ce{Ox} + n e^{-} \ce{\rightleftharpoons}
\ce{Red}\]</span> where Ox is the oxidized form and Red is the reduced
form of an analyte. These four figures, individually or collectively,
are our tools for understanding chronoamperometry experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Ladder Diagram (upper left)</strong>. A ladder (or
predominance) diagram shows the relative stability of an analyte’s
oxidized and reduced forms as a function of the applied potential and
the analyte’s formal potential, which in this case is <span class="math inline">\(-0.25 \text{ V}\)</span>. For potentials more
positive than <span class="math inline">\(-0.25 \text{ V}\)</span>, the
analyte’s oxidized form, Ox, is more stable than its reduced form, and
for potentials more negative than <span class="math inline">\(-0.25
\text{ V}\)</span>, the analyte’s reduced form, Red, is more stable than
its oxidized form. At the formal potential, the oxidized and reduced
forms are equally stable, and equal in concentration.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Profile (upper right)</strong>. In a
chronoamperometry experiment, the applied potential profile has three
sections: first, the potential is set and held constant at a value where
the analyte does not undergo an oxidation or a reduction reaction;
second, the potential is pulsed to a value where the analyte is oxidized
or reduced; and, third, the applied potential is held at this value. In
the experiment shown here an applied potential of 0.0 V is applied for
10 seconds and then pulsed to a potential of –0.5 V and held at this
potential for an additional 10 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Diffusion Profiles (lower left)</strong>. A diffusion profile
shows the concentration of the analyte’s oxidized and reduced forms as a
function of distance from the electrode’s surface at a specific time;
here the diffusion profiles are shown at the beginning of the experiment
(<span class="math inline">\(t = 0 \text{ s}\)</span>) and at the end of
the experiment (<span class="math inline">\(t = 20 \text{
s}\)</span>).</p>
<p><strong>Chronoamperogram (lower right)</strong>. The chronoamperogram
shows the current that flows as a function of time. This is the tangible
result of a chronoamperometry experiment.</p>
