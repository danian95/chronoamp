<p><span class="math inline">\(\require{mhchem} \ce{}\)</span>In a
chronoamperometry experiment we apply a potential pulse to an electrode
and measure (‑<em>ometry</em>) the current (‑<em>amper</em>‑) that flows
as a function of time (<em>chrono</em>‑) in an unstirred solution. The
panel on the right provides four views of a chronoamperometry experiment
in which an oxidized analyte undergoes an <em>n</em> electron reduction
at the electrode where Ox is the oxidized form and Red is the reduced
form of an analyte. <span class="math display">\[\ce{Ox} + n e^{-}
\ce{\rightleftharpoons} \ce{Red}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Ladder Diagram (upper left)</strong>. A ladder (or
predominance) diagram shows the relative stability of an analyte’s
oxidized and reduced forms as a function of the applied potential and
the analyte’s formal potential, which in this case is –0.25 V. For
potentials more positive than –0.25 V, the analyte’s oxidized form, Ox,
is more stable than its reduced form, and for potentials more negative
than –0.25 V, the analyte’s reduced form, Red, is more stable than its
oxidized form. At the formal potential, the oxidized and reduced forms
are equally stable, and equal in concentration.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Profile (upper right)</strong>. In a
chronoamperometry experiment, the applied potential profile has three
sections: first, the potential is set and held constant at a value where
the analyte does not undergo an oxidation or a reduction reaction;
second, the potential is pulsed to a value where the analyte is oxidized
or reduced; and, third, the applied potential is held at this value. In
the experiment shown here a potential of 0.5 V is applied for 10
seconds, pulsed to a potential of –0.50 V, and then held at this
potential for an additional 10 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Diffusion Profiles (lower left)</strong>. A diffusion profile
shows the concentration of the analyte’s oxidized and reduced forms as a
function of distance from the electrode’s surface at a specific time;
here the diffusion profiles are shown at the beginning of the experiment
(<em>t</em> = 0 s) and at the end of the experiment (<em>t</em> = 20
s).</p>
<p><strong>Chronoamperogram (lower right)</strong>. The chronoamperogram
shows the current that flows as a function of time. This is the tangible
result of a chronoamperometry experiment.</p>
