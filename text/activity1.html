<p>The four figures on the right describe a chronoamperometry experiment
for the reversible one-electron reduction <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Ox} + e^- \ce{\rightleftharpoons}
\ce{Red}\)</span>. The initial concentration of Ox is <span class="math inline">\(1.0\)</span> mM and the initial concentration of
Red is <span class="math inline">\(0.0\)</span> mM. A potential of <span class="math inline">\(0.0\)</span> V is maintained for <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> s and then pulsed to –<span class="math inline">\(0.50\)</span> V where it is held for an additional
<span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> s. The solution remains
unstirred throughout the experiment. You can use the slider to explore
how the applied potential, the diffusion profiles for Ox and Red, and
the current change with time during this <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> s experiment. Clicking on the slider’s
play button steps through the experiment in 1 s intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Using the ladder diagram as a guide,
will a redox reaction take place if the applied potential is pulsed from
<span class="math inline">\(0.0\)</span> V to –<span class="math inline">\(0.1\)</span> V? What if the applied potential is
pulsed from <span class="math inline">\(0.0\)</span> V to –<span class="math inline">\(0.4\)</span> V?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Examine the diffusion profiles for Ox
and for Red at times <em>t</em> = <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <em>t</em> = <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, <em>t</em> = <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>, <em>t</em> = <span class="math inline">\(15\)</span>, and <em>t</em> = <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> s, and describe features they share
and features they do not share.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Examine the diffusion profiles for Ox
and for Red at <em>t</em> = <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> s
and note that the concentration of Ox is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> mM at the electrode’s surface, <span class="math inline">\(1.0\)</span> mM when sufficiently far from the
electrode. Why is there no Ox at the electrode’s surface? Explain why
the concentration of Ox is not <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> mM
at all distances from the electrode’s surface. It might be useful to
know that the electrode has a surface area of <span class="math inline">\(0.01\)</span> cm<sup>2</sup> and that the sample
has a volume on the order of <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span>
mL.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Current is a measure of the rate at
which Ox is reduced to Red—or the rate at which Red is oxidized to
Ox—and is proportional to the slope of the diffusion profile evaluated
at the electrode’s surface. Given this, explain (a) why the current is
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> when <em>t</em> &lt; <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> s; (b) why the current spikes to its
maximum value when <em>t</em> = <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>
s; and (c) why the current decreases when <em>t</em> &gt; <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> s.</p>
