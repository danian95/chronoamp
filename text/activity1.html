<p>The four figures on the right describe a chronoamperometry experiment
for the reversible one-electron reduction <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Ox} + e^- \ce{\rightleftharpoons}
\ce{Red}\)</span>. The initial concentration of Ox is 1.0 mM and the
initial concentration of Red is 0.0 mM. A potential of 0.0 V is
maintained for 10 s and then pulsed to –0.50 V where it is held for an
additional 10 s. The solution remains unstirred throughout the
experiment. You can use the slider to explore how the applied potential,
the diffusion profiles for Ox and Red, and the current change with time
during this 20 s experiment. Clicking on the slider’s play button steps
through the experiment in 1 s intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Using the ladder diagram as a guide,
will a redox reaction take place if the applied potential is pulsed from
0.0 V to –0.1 V? What if the applied potential is pulsed from 0.0 V to
–0.4 V?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Examine the diffusion profiles for Ox
and for Red at times <em>t</em> = 0, <em>t</em> = 5, <em>t</em> = 10,
<em>t</em> = 15, and <em>t</em> = 20 s, and describe features they share
and features they do not share.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Examine the diffusion profiles for Ox
and for Red at <em>t</em> = 20 s and note that the concentration of Ox
is 0 mM at the electrode’s surface, 1.0 mM when sufficiently far from
the electrode. Why is there no Ox at the electrode’s surface? Explain
why the concentration of Ox is not 0 mM at all distances from the
electrode’s surface. It might be useful to know that the electrode has a
surface area of 0.01 cm<sup>2</sup> and that the sample has a volume on
the order of 50 mL.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Current is a measure of the rate at
which Ox is reduced to Red—or the rate at which Red is oxidized to
Ox—and is proportional to the slope of the diffusion profile evaluated
at the electrode’s surface. Given this, explain (a) why the current is 0
when <em>t</em> &lt; 10 s; (b) why the current spikes to its maximum
value when <em>t</em> = 10 s; and (c) why the current decreases when
<em>t</em> &gt; 10 s.</p>
