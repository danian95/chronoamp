<p>The four figures on the right describe a chronoamperometry experiment
for the reversible one-electron reduction <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Ox} + e^- \ce{\rightleftharpoons}
\ce{Red}\)</span>. The initial concentration of Ox is 1.0 mM and the
initial concentration of Red is 0.0 mM. A potential of <span class="math inline">\(0.0 \text{ V}\)</span> is maintained for 10 s and
then pulsed to <span class="math inline">\(-0.5 \text{ V}\)</span> where
it is held for an additional 10 s. The solution remains unstirred
throughout the experiment. You can use the slider to explore how the
applied potential, the diffusion profiles for Ox and Red, and the
current change with time during this 20 s experiment. Clicking on the
slider’s play button steps through the experiment in 1 s intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Using the ladder diagram as a guide,
will a redox reaction take place if the applied potential is pulsed from
<span class="math inline">\(0 \text{ V}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(-0.1 \text{ V}\)</span>? What if the applied
potential is pulsed from <span class="math inline">\(0 \text{
V}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(-0.4 \text{ V}\)</span>?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Examine the diffusion profiles for Ox
and for Red at times <span class="math inline">\(t = 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t = 5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t =
10\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t = 15\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(t = 20\)</span> s, and describe features they
share and features they do not share.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Examine the diffusion profiles for Ox
and for Red at <span class="math inline">\(t = 20\)</span> and note that
the concentration of Ox is 0 mM at the electrode’s surface, but 1.0 mM
when sufficiently far from the electrode. Why is there no Ox at the
electrode’s surface? Explain why the concentration of Ox is not 0 mM at
all distances from the electrode’s surface. It might be useful to know
that the electrode has a surface area of 0.01 cm<sup>2</sup> and that
the sample has a volume on the order of 50 mL.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Current is a measure of the rate at
which Ox is reduced to Red—or the rate at which Red is oxidized to
Ox—and is proportional to the slope of the diffusion profile evaluated
at the electrode’s surface. Given this, explain (a) why the current is 0
when <span class="math inline">\(t &lt; 10 \text{ s}\)</span>; (b) why
the current spikes to its maximum value when <span class="math inline">\(t = 10 \text{ s}\)</span>; and (c) why the current
decreases when <span class="math inline">\(t &gt; 10 \text{
s}\)</span>.</p>
