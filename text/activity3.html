<p>The chronoamperometry experiment outlined in the introduction uses a
single potential pulse and monitors the current that flows. In a
double-step chronoamperometry experiment we follow the initial pulse and
measurement of current with a second pulse—the double in
double-step—that returns the potential to its initial value.</p>

<h4>Studying Systems of Coupled Reactions</h4>
<p>Double-step chronoamperometry is used to study systems of reactions
that include a redox reaction and a chemical reaction. Such a system of
reactions is called coupled. For example, the reversible one electron
reduction of an oxidized species, Ox, to a reduced species, Red,
followed by the irreversible chemical reaction of Red to form Z is an
example of coupling a reversible redox reaction to an irreversible
chemical reaction. Note that Z does not undergo oxidation or
reduction.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\ce{Ox} + e^- \ce{\rightleftharpoons}
\ce{Red} \quad \quad \quad \ce{Red} \ce{\rightarrow} \ce{Z}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. The coupled reactions begins with a
reversible redox reaction followed by an irreversible chemical reaction
(this mechanism is usually abbreviated as <span class="math inline">\(\ce{E}_r \ce{C}_i\)</span>). What does it mean to
say that a reaction is reversible? What does it mean to say that a
reaction is irreversible?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. The concentration of Red at the
electrode’s surface depends, in part, on how quickly it reacts to form
Z, which is determined by the reaction’s rate constant and how soon
after the first potential pulse we apply the second potential pulse.
Based on this description, predict the effect on the current of
increasing the rate constant for the reaction <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Red} \ce{\rightarrow} \ce{Z}\)</span>, and the
effect on the current of decreasing the time between the first and the
second potential pulse.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. The figure on the right shows the
double-step chronoamperogram as a thin black dashed line when the rate
constant, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Red} \ce{\rightarrow} \ce{Z}\)</span> is set
to zero—that is, the when the reaction <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Red} \ce{\rightarrow} \ce{Z}\)</span> does not
take place—and shows the current for the experiment defined by the two
sliders as a thick, solid blue line. Use the sliders to evaluate your
predictions from the previous exercise.</p>
