<p>The chronoamperometry experiment outlined in the introduction
monitored the current following a single potential pulse. In a
double-step chronoamperometry experiment we follow the initial pulse and
measurement of current with a second pulse—the double in
double-step—that returns the potential to its initial value.</p>

<h4>Studying Systems of Coupled Reactions</h4>
<p>Double-step chronoamperometry is used to study systems of reactions
that include a redox reaction and a chemical reaction. Such a system of
reactions is called coupled. For example, the reversible one electron
reduction of an oxidized species to a reduced species, <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Ox} + e^- \ce{\rightleftharpoons}
\ce{Red}\)</span>, followed by the irreversible chemical reaction of the
reduced species to form a non-redox active product, <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Red} \ce{\rightarrow} \ce{Z}\)</span>, is an
example of coupling a reversible redox reaction to an irreversible
chemical reaction.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. The coupled reactions begins with a
reversible redox reaction followed by an irreversible chemical reaction
(this mechanism is usually abbreviated as <span class="math inline">\(\ce{E}_r \ce{C}_i\)</span>). What does it mean to
say that a reaction is reversible? What does it mean to say that a
reaction is irreversible?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. The concentration of Red at the
electrode’s surface depends, in part, on how quickly it reacts to form
Z, which is determined by the reaction’s rate constant and how soon
after the first potential pulse we apply the second potential pulse.
Based on this description, predict the effect on the current of
increasing the rate constant for the reaction <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Red} \ce{\rightarrow} \ce{Z}\)</span>, and the
effect on the current of decreasing the time between the first and the
second potential pulse.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. The figure on the right shows the
double-step chronoamperogram as a thin black dashed line when the rate
constant, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Red} \ce{\rightarrow} \ce{Z}\)</span> is set
to zero—that is, when the reaction <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Red}
\ce{\rightarrow} \ce{Z}\)</span> does not occur—and the second pulse is
at 20 s. The solid blue line shows the current when the rate constant is
greater than 0 and when the second pulse is at less than 20 s. Use the
sliders to evaluate your predictions from the previous exercise.</p>
