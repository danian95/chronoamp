<p>The current in a chronoamperometry experiment is given by the
Cottrell equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[i(t) = \frac{n F A C
\sqrt{D}}{\sqrt{\pi}\sqrt{t}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(i(t)\)</span> is the current at a
time, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, after the pulse is
applied, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of
electrons in the redox reaction, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
is the area of the electrode in cm<sup>2</sup>, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the diffusion coefficient for the
electroactive species (Ox or Red) in cm<sup>2</sup>/s, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is its concentration in mol/L, and
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is Faraday’s constant (96,458
C/mol, where C is a coulomb). You can adjust the values for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> using the radio buttons above the
chronoamperogram on the right. Values for the current, <span class="math inline">\(i(t)\)</span>, at integer times from 12 s to 20 s
appear above the orange points that mark their corresponding times.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Thinking about the experiment’s design
(not the equation itself), explain why an increase in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> results in a larger current, but an
increase in <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> results in a smaller
current.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Use the radio buttons to verify that the
relationship between <span class="math inline">\(i(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is linear, but that there is a
square-root relationship between <span class="math inline">\(i(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, and an inverse square-root
relationship between <span class="math inline">\(i(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Current is measured in amperes (A),
which is equivalent to coulombs per second; that is, 1 C/s = 1 A. Show
that the units on the right side of the Cottrell equation yield a
current in amperes; you do not need to use specific numerical values for
any of the variables. Although we usually report concentration in mol/L,
for this exercise you need to express volume using units of
mol/cm<sup>3</sup>. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Set the radio buttons to <span class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A =
0.01 \text{ cm}^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(D =
1\times10^{-5} \text{ cm}^2\text{/s}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C = 0.001 \text{ mol/L}\)</span>, and make note of
the current in µA at a total elapsed time of 14 s. Verify that this
current is correct by using the Cottrell equation to calculate the
current. Be sure to consider your work on Exercise 3 and to consider the
meaning of time in the Cottrell equation.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 5</strong>. Explain how you can use the Cottrell
equation to determine the concentration of an analyte in a sample.</p>
