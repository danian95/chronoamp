$\require{mhchem} \ce{}$In a chronoamperometry experiment we apply a potential pulse to an electrode and measure (&#8209;*ometry*) the current (&#8209;*amper*&#8209;) that flows as a function of time (*chrono*&#8209;) in an unstirred solution. The panel on the right provides four views of a chronoamperometry experiment in which an oxidized analyte undergoes an *n* electron reduction at the electrode where Ox is the oxidized form and Red is the reduced form of an analyte. 
$$\ce{Ox} + n e^{-} \ce{\rightleftharpoons} \ce{Red}$$ 

**Ladder Diagram (upper left)**. A ladder (or predominance) diagram shows the relative stability of an analyte's oxidized and reduced forms as a function of the applied potential and the analyte's formal potential, which in this case is --0.25 V. For potentials more positive than --0.25 V, the analyte's oxidized form, Ox, is more stable than its reduced form, and for potentials more negative than --0.25 V, the analyte's reduced form, Red, is more stable than its oxidized form. At the formal potential, the oxidized and reduced forms are equally stable, and equal in concentration.

**Potential Profile (upper right)**. In a chronoamperometry experiment, the applied potential profile has three sections: first, the potential is set and held constant at a value where the analyte does not undergo an oxidation or a reduction reaction; second, the potential is pulsed to a value where the analyte is oxidized or reduced; and, third, the applied potential is held at this value. In the experiment shown here a potential of 0.5 V is applied for 10 seconds, pulsed to a potential of --0.50 V, and then held at this potential for an additional 10 seconds. 

**Diffusion Profiles (lower left)**. A diffusion profile shows the concentration of the analyte's oxidized and reduced forms as a function of distance from the electrode's surface at a specific time; here the diffusion profiles are shown at the beginning of the experiment (*t* = 0 s) and at the end of the experiment (*t* = 20 s).

**Chronoamperogram (lower right)**. The chronoamperogram shows the current that flows as a function of time. This is the tangible result of a chronoamperometry experiment.
