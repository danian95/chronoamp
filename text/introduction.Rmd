$\require{mhchem} \ce{}$In a chronoamperometry experiment we apply a potential pulse to an electrode and measure $(-ometry)$ the current $(-amper-)$ that flows as a function of time $(chrono-)$ in an unstirred solution. The figure on the right provides four views of a chronoamperometry experiment in which an oxidized analyte undergoes an *n* electron reduction at the electrode
$$\ce{Ox} + n e^{-} \ce{\rightleftharpoons} \ce{Red}$$ 
where Ox is the oxidized form and Red is the reduced form of an analyte. These four figures, individually or collectively, are our tools for understanding chronoamperometry experiments.

**Ladder Diagram (upper left)**. A ladder (or predominance) diagram shows the relative stability of an analyte's oxidized and reduced forms as a function of the applied potential and the analyte's formal potential, which in this case is $-0.25 \text{ V}$. For potentials more positive than $-0.25 \text{ V}$, the analyte's oxidized form, Ox, is more stable than its reduced form, and for potentials more negative than $-0.25 \text{ V}$, the analyte's reduced form, Red, is more stable than its oxidized form. At the formal potential, the oxidized and reduced forms are equally stable, and equal in concentration.

**Potential Profile (upper right)**. In a chronoamperometry experiment, the applied potential profile has three sections: first, the potential is set and held constant at a value where the analyte does not undergo an oxidation or a reduction reaction; second, the potential is pulsed to a value where the analyte is oxidized or reduced; and, third, the applied potential is held at this value. In the experiment shown here an applied potential of 0.0 V is applied for 10 seconds and then pulsed to a potential of --0.5 V and held at this potential for an additional 10 seconds. 

**Diffusion Profiles (lower left)**. A diffusion profile shows the concentration of the analyte's oxidized and reduced forms as a function of distance from the electrode's surface at a specific time; here the diffusion profiles are shown at the beginning of the experiment ($t = 0 \text{ s}$) and at the end of the experiment ($t = 20 \text{ s}$).

**Chronoamperogram (lower right)**. The chronoamperogram shows the current that flows as a function of time. This is the tangible result of a chronoamperometry experiment.
