#### Source of Data

The data sets in this module were created using `eChem`, a package of `R` functions for simulating a variety of electrochemistry experiments. The simulation calculations use the implicit finite difference method outlined in [D. K. Gosser, *Cyclic Voltammetry Simulation and Analysis of Reaction Mechanisms*, VCH, New York, 1993](https://books.google.com/books/about/Cyclic_Voltammetry.html?id=rqldPgAACAAJ) and in J.H. Brown "Development and Use of a Cyclic Voltammetry Simulator to Introduce Undergraduate Students to Electrochemical Simulations," *J. Chem. Educ.*, **2015**, *92*, 1490--1496](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00225). Although both of these resources were developed to simulate cyclic voltammetry experiments, their approach is easy to generalize to other diffusion-controlled electrochemistry experiments, such as chronoamperometry and chronocoulometry. 

The `eChem` package is available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eChem/index.html) and from [GitHub](https://github.com/dtharvey/eChem). In addition to a functions to simulate electrochemistry experiments, the `eChem` package includes functions to display the results of these experiments. One example is shown on the right. The central figure is the chronoamperogram for a chronoamperometry experiment. Surrounding the chronoamperogram are snapshots of the concentration profiles for Ox and Red at eight times---the time and potential for each are listed above the chronoamperogram---during the experiment.
