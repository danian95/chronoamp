<h4>Source of Data</h4>
<p>The data sets in this module were created using <code>eChem</code>, a
package of <code>R</code> functions for simulating a variety of
electrochemistry experiments. The simulations use the implicit finite
difference method outlined in <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Cyclic_Voltammetry.html?id=rqldPgAACAAJ">D.
K. Gosser, <em>Cyclic Voltammetry Simulation and Analysis of Reaction
Mechanisms</em>, VCH, New York, 1993</a> and in J.H. Brown <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00225">“Development and Use
of a Cyclic Voltammetry Simulator to Introduce Undergraduate Students to
Electrochemical Simulations,” <em>J. Chem. Educ.</em>,
<strong>2015</strong>, <em>92</em>, 1490–1496</a> to calculate the
current in chronoamperometry experiments; the charge in a
chronocoulometry experiment is calculated using a trapezoidal
integration of the corresponding chronoamperometry experiment. Although
both of these resources were developed to simulate cyclic voltammetry
experiments, their approach is easy to generalize to other
diffusion-controlled electrochemistry experiments, such as
chronoamperometry and chronocoulometry.</p>
<p>The <code>eChem</code> package is available from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eChem/index.html">CRAN</a>
and from <a href="https://github.com/dtharvey/eChem">GitHub</a>. In
addition to a functions to simulate electrochemistry experiments, the
<code>eChem</code> package includes functions to display the results of
these experiments. One example is the <code>plotGrid</code> function,
which is shown on the right. The central figure is the chronoamperogram
for a chronoamperometry experiment. Surrounding the chronoamperogram are
snapshots of the concentration profiles for Ox and Red at eight
times—the time and the potential for each are listed above the
chronoamperogram—during the experiment.</p>
