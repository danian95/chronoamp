<p>Integrating the current in a chronoamperometry experiment as a
function of time gives the cumulative charge, <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, in coulombs passed during the redox
reaction. In a chronocoulometry experiment we take the output of a
chronoamperometry experiment and run it through an integrator. The
result is a plot of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Examine the chronoamperometry experiment
in the module’s tab for a typical experiment and review what you learned
about the shape of the current trace as a function of time. Think about
what it means to integrate a function and predict the shape of the
corresponding plot of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Use the slider to test your prediction
and comment on your results. Clicking on the slider’s play button steps
through the experiment in 1 s intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. What advantage(s) might chronocoulometry
have over chronoamperometry? Consider, for example, using
chronoamperometry and chronocoulometry to determine the concentration of
an analyte in a sample. Which method would you use and why?</p>
