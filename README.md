# chronoamp

This module introduces students to chronoamperometry using four primary types of visual features: ladder diagrams, and time-dependent applied potential profiles, diffusion profiles, and current profiles. The Cottrell equation is introduced and verified using simulated data. A brief introduction is included to double-step chronoamperometry and chronocoulometry.
